We developed  an Electronic Health Record system tailored for pets, similar to human EHR platforms like MyChart. Some features(datasets) for this project  include; microchip identification, appointment management, vaccine tracking, and access to lab results and visit summaries. The pet EHR system will empower pet owners and veterinarians to track and manage pet health data efficiently and enhance pet healthcare outcomes.
